# Bookbridge

BookBridge is a mobile application system that enables users to buy and sell preloved books instead of throwing them away. It aims to lessen the effects of overbuying books by encouraging users to recycle preloved books and earn money from it. The application has three main features: 
- Book listing: Enables the users to find preloved books as well as add books for people to buy them.
- In-built chat: Allows the users to chat in real-time and ask for more information about the books they are interested in.
- Ratings: When the negotiations are done, the users can leave a rating to the seller. This can help buyers to make intelligent choices and encourages the seller to sell books by leaving good reviews.
